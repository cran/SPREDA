Description: The Statistical Package for REliability Data Analysis (SPREDA) implements recently-developed statistical methods for the analysis of reliability data. Modern technological developments, such as sensors and smart chips, allow us to dynamically track product/system usage as well as other environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity. We refer to these variables as dynamic covariates. The package contains functions for the analysis of time-to-event data with dynamic covariates and degradation data with dynamic covariates. The package also contains functions that can be used for analyzing time-to-event data with right censoring, and with left truncation and right censoring. Financial support from NSF and DuPont are acknowledged.
